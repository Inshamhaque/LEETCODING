 # Moving Zeroes to the End of an Array

This code demonstrates two methods for moving all zeroes in an array to the end while preserving the order of non-zero elements. The first method, `brute`, is straightforward but inefficient, while the second method, `better`, is more efficient and uses a two-pointer approach.

## Brute Force Method (`brute` Function)

The `brute` function creates a temporary array `temp` of the same size as the input array `arr`. It then iterates through the elements of `arr` and copies non-zero elements to `temp`. The number of non-zero elements is counted in the variable `cnt`.

```cpp
void brute(int* arr, int n) {
    int* temp;
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (arr[i] != 0) {
            temp[i] = arr[i];
            cnt++;
        }
    }
}
```

After copying all non-zero elements, the remaining elements in `temp` are set to zero. Finally, the contents of `temp` are copied back to `arr`.

## Efficient Method (`better` Function)

The `better` function uses a two-pointer approach to move zeroes to the end of the array. Two pointers, `start` and `end`, are initialized to the beginning and end of the array, respectively. The algorithm works as follows:

1. If the element at `start` is non-zero, `start` is incremented.
2. If the element at `end` is zero, `end` is decremented.
3. If the element at `start` is zero and the element at `end` is non-zero, the elements at `start` and `end` are swapped.
4. Steps 1-3 are repeated until `start` is greater than or equal to `end`.

```cpp
void better(int* arr, int n) {
    int start = 0;
    int end = n - 1;
    while (start <= end) {
        if (arr[start] == 0) {
            if (arr[end] == 0) {
                end--;
            }
            swap(arr[start], arr[end]);
            end
